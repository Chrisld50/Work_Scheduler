# Work_Scheduler

# Description 
My motivation was to apply bootstrap, javascript and jquery to an html with css already created to make a functional work scheduler calender that changes colors based on past time, present time and future time. This works by saving what is written within the schedule in local storage and changes the colors of the columns based on the time of day utilizing a timeframe from 9 am to 5 pm. My challenges were around converting the time from Standard time to Military time so that my .moments would work correctly. There was also some challenges when it came to getting the local storage to work. I was able to get local storage to both set and get at the end and the colors to change correctly based on the time.
